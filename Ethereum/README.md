# What is Ethereum?
Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform that is best known for its cryptocurrency, ETH.

The blockchain technology that powers Ethereum enables secure digital ledgers to be publicly created and maintained.
Bitcoin and Ethereum have many similarities but different long-term visions and limitations.

Ethereum is transitioning to an operational protocol that offers incentives to process transactions to those who own the largest amounts of ETH.
